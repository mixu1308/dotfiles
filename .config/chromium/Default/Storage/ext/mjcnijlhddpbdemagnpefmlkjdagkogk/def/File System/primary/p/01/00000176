<p nodeIndex="38">Peach&sup3; has been replaced with a Canvas App: Momotor LTI Tool Provider</p>
<p nodeIndex="39">This makes the automated checking of submissions as done by peach&sup3; available in Canvas. All other peach&sup3; functionality, including peer reviews and plagiarism detection, is not part of the Momotor App since these functionalities either already exist in Canvas or other Canvas add-ons.</p>
<p nodeIndex="40">Documentation on how to enable Momotor for a course can be found in the <a href="https://momotor.org/doc/lti/canvas/index.html?from=peach3" target="_blank" nodeIndex="65">"Momotor LTI Tool Provider" online documentation</a> and on the <a href="https://momotor.org/?from=peach3" target="_blank" nodeIndex="66">Momotor project website</a>.</p>
