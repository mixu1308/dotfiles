</p><p brd="1" nodeIndex="320"><span nodeIndex="981">Purpose and Main Idea:</span></p>
<p brd="1" nodeIndex="321">I wanted a build that was if a small form factor, allowing easier transportation when gaming with friends without sacrificing cooling power when at home and overclocking. I also wanted to create as clean of a build visually as I could which is where the idea for this came from. I developed a quick disconnect system from S5 to pedestal allowing my to separate the two. The name "White Metropolis" started out because I was trying to brainstorm a name that wasn't too cliche with a white build and went with that with no intention of including the name into the theme. That all changed when I got inspired by city silhouettes. In this build you will find the silhouettes of major cities all across the world such as Hong Kong - China, Bangkok - Thailand and Jakarta - Indonesia because of how they looked. I've hopefully succeeded in tying all these things together in a visually appealing, high detail design. Having windows all around led for designing ideas the complement the computer no matter which side you look at it so no matter where you view it from you get a different and equally pleasing view.</p>

<p brd="1" nodeIndex="323">The idea is to have the main cabin of the S5 be easily detachable with the bottom. So when home I'll be running a decent overclock through the 240 rad up top and a 360 rad in the pedestal. When I'm using it portable I will detach it from the pedestal (QDC's) and through the use of a Bitspower Valve redirect the flow.</p>

<p brd="1" nodeIndex="326">I've seen love and hate comments for white builds but this is my personal rig and ultimately I gotta go with what I want so it'll be white with a little darker than sky blue accents all throughout the case.</p>

Expect many progress photos, videos, and other fun things. I plan to make any videos I do of progress be on the interesting/comical side but we will see how it goes. I'll do my best to provide quality pictures and I will ask for feedback along the way on design choices. I have waited for a while to start the build log because I'm not one who wants a 4 month build log to keep people waiting.
