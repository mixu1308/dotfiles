<p nodeIndex="84">I first made this dish after Mike and I ordered it at our favorite Indian restaurant.&nbsp;One of my favorite things about it is that because&nbsp;there&rsquo;s quite a bit of&nbsp;paprika in it, it reminds me of Hungarian Goulash, which my mom used to make all the time when I was a kid.&nbsp;Because of this, even though I never tasted Rogan Josh until I was an adult, its taste always reminds me of my childhood.<span nodeIndex="539"></span></p>

<p nodeIndex="86">Our favorite way to eat this dish is with basmati rice and Salad Shirazi, which is just a salad made of diced cucumber, tomato, onion, and parsley dressed with olive oil and lemon juice or vinegar, and seasoned with salt. I like to add pomegranate arils for sweet/tart flavor, and you can switch it up by using different aromatics like fresh mint, chives, scallion, etc.</p>
