<ol class="recipe-steps-list" nodeIndex="232"><li class="recipe-steps-item" nodeIndex="231">Heat the ghee in a wok or heavy-bottomed saucepan and deep-fry the onions on low-medium heat until they get a nice golden brown color.</li>
<li class="recipe-steps-item" nodeIndex="233">Remove the fried onions from the pan. Mix yogurt with the onions in a blender so you get a creamy paste.</li>
<li class="recipe-steps-item" nodeIndex="234">Reheat the ghee in the saucepan. Once it gets hot add cloves, bay leaf, cinnamon stick, star anise, green cardamom pods and black peppercorns. Fry for 30 seconds or until they start to sizzle.</li>
<li class="recipe-steps-item" nodeIndex="235">Add the chicken thighs and drumsticks. Season thoroughly with salt. Add the ginger garlic paste, combine well and fry for about 2 minutes.</li>
<li class="recipe-steps-item" nodeIndex="236">Add turmeric, red chili powder, coriander powder, garam masala and cumin powder. Combine well and fry for 2 more minutes.</li>
<li class="recipe-steps-item" nodeIndex="237">Add the fried onion yogurt paste, combine well. Add some water. You can use the water to rinse out the blender so don't waste any of the paste. Mix well.</li>

<li class="recipe-steps-item" nodeIndex="239">Garnish with fresh cilantro.</li>
