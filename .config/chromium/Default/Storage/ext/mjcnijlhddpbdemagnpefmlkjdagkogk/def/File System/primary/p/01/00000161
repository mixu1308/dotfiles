<p nodeIndex="49">So I recently realized that there was a real problem on All Day I Dream About Food. Like a very serious issue that was perhaps affecting my status as a first rate low carb food blogger. It hit me hard one day when I did a little survey of my recipes and I was stunned to discover my error. I should have caught on sooner, to be honest. I pride myself on being pretty bright and tuned in and I&rsquo;d apparently been very tuned out. I have some serious making up to do, it would seem. Rest assured, your favourite low carb baking expert is on the case now. I won&rsquo;t let it happen again. The good news is that my upcoming cookbook, <a href="http://amzn.to/2tzp9bR" rel="nofollow" nodeIndex="1465"><strong nodeIndex="1466">The Everyday Ketogenic Kitchen</strong></a>, does have a number of basic low carb recipes.</p>

<p nodeIndex="52">What it comes down to is that there is a serious dearth of classic and basic low carb recipe makeovers. See, I have this problem where I don&rsquo;t like to make &ldquo;plain&rdquo; recipes. Readers send me their family favourites all the time, asking me to make them over. And I take a peek and think it looks like something I should do. Except I don&rsquo;t just do it as it is or as requested. I find I have to give it a twist, a unique flavour, a little jazzy jazz. This is a long-standing habit for me. I&rsquo;ve always loved to take a recipe and put a unique spin on it&hellip;a regular brownie recipe from Cook&rsquo;s Illustrated became a Cappuccino White Chocolate Brownie under my deft hands. A classic chocolate chip cookie from the Joy of Cooking became Pecan Coconut Chocolate Chip Cookies. Or adding a peanut butter layer to a cake that only took vanilla. That was always my thing &nbsp;back in my conventional baking days and it seems to be a bit of my thing now. It&rsquo;s a hard habit to break.</p>
<div id="RIL_IMG_3" class="RIL_IMG"></div>
<p nodeIndex="54">But so many followers turn to me for low carb baking guidance and I realize that I&rsquo;ve failed them a bit. Whenever I am asked if I have a classic recipe for this or that treat, I often have to say no. Shame on me! I can usually guide them to one of my keto dessert recipes and tell them how to make it more of a classic, but I don&rsquo;t have the basic recipe for them to work from. And that&rsquo;s something I feel I need to address.</p>
<div id="RIL_IMG_4" class="RIL_IMG"></div>
<p nodeIndex="56">That doesn&rsquo;t mean I will stop making the fanciful cakes and cookies and such. Oh no&hellip;that is an absolute compulsion for me, it would seem. But I have to get back to some basics so that you have the benefit of a standard low carb recipe from which to work. And then, should you feel like getting all fancy yourself, you can have at it and play with my basic recipe to come up with your own fun twist. And so we start with these delicious keto chocolate cake donuts. A basic coconut flour chocolate donut with a delicious sugar-free chocolate glaze. Ain&rsquo;t nothing wrong with the basics, if you ask me. Ask my kids too, as they seemed to think these were the best low carb donuts I&rsquo;d ever made.</p>
